# Memory Card Game Project
The project is a memory card game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to match pairs of cards with identical images. The game provides cognitive stimulation and entertainment, making it useful for younger audiences.

## Game Mechanics
The game defines a function to handle the clicking of checkboxes. When two checkboxes are clicked, the function checks if the images on the cards match. If they match, the checkboxes remain checked, and if they don't match, they become unchecked after a second. The game then shuffles an array of image URLs and assigns them to the cards, creating randomized cards for the game.

## Benefits of the Game
Memory games are known to improve memory and concentration skills, making this game a useful tool for cognitive development. Additionally, the game provides an interactive experience, making it a fun and engaging way to spend time.

## Public Availability

The game is created by a group of web development students at NTNU Gjovik, consisting of **Petter, Emil, and Tobias** .
