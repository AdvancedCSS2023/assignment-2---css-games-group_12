The project is a memory card game where the player needs to match pairs of cards with identical images. It first defines a function to handle the clicking of checkboxes, which checks if two checkboxes have been clicked and matches the images on the cards. If they match, the checkboxes remain checked, and if they don't match, they become unchecked after a second. The code then shuffles an array of image URLs and assigns them to the cards, creating randomized cards for the game. 

This game is useful because it creates an interactive game that can provide entertainment and cognitive stimulation for users. Memory games are also a popular way to improve memory and concentration skills. This game is targeted at a younger audience. 

The game is built using only html, css and javascript.

This game is made by a group of web development students at NTNU Gjovik. The group consists of Petter, Emil and Tobias.
